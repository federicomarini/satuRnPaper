### Availability of data

The datasets required to reproduce all results that are displayed in this publication (including supplementary materials) are available from Zenodo. This includes both the raw data and intermediate results. Note that at the top of each analysis script it is indicated which dataset is required as input for the script; it may thus not be necessary to download all datasets from Zenodo. For easily reproducing the results, place the downloaded data in this `Data` folder.
